## Objectives of the Teaching Session

+ To become aware of the reasons that explain the complexity of managing ecosystems.
+ To understand the concept of emergent property.
+ To comprehend the concept of system and its different characteristics.



## Argumentative Thread

+ The classic definition of an ecosystem (a set of organisms living in a territory, along with their relationships, etc.) is adequate for an exam. It describes the reality of ecosystems in a somewhat simplistic manner. Furthermore, it lacks something important in good definitions: questions. A definition that does not allow for questions is somewhat boring. Therefore, in this session, we will redefine the concept of ecosystem to achieve a deeper understanding.
+ Moreover, this definition is reductionist and mechanistic. This means it tries to describe the ecosystem by focusing on the structural elements that comprise it. This is useful for some purposes but not so much for the subject of ecosystem management. This definition prevents us from seeing, for example, the properties of the ecosystem in a general way.
+ We need to understand well what an ecosystem is because it is what, in theory, we will learn to manage in this subject.
+ We will start by saying that an ecosystem is a system. It may not seem like a much better definition than the previous one, but it is. A system is *a set of elements that coexist in the domain of time and space and interact to achieve a specific purpose*. In this case, we consider that purpose does not carry anthropomorphic connotations. In other words, we do not relate purpose to human consciousness. A bacterium can have a purpose even if it is not aware of it.
+ When we view reality using the concept of a system, we realize that there are many systems. More or less intuitively, we can describe different systems with varying levels of complexity. For example, a glass containing water is a simpler system than a storm with lightning and thunder. And this is simpler than an ecosystem.
+ How do these three systems we have used as examples differ? One way to establish differences or similarities between objects or concepts is to try to describe them using the same characteristics. For instance, we can say that Pedro differs from Ana and Luisa in eye color or hair length. Eye color and hair length are the characteristics we use to compare the entities Pedro, Ana, and Luisa. In the case of systems, we will use three types of characteristics:
  + Diversity of elements in the system. Recall that diversity includes two concepts: the number of different elements (species, types of eye colors, etc.) and the abundance of each of these types (the number of individuals of each species, the number of people with a given eye color, etc.).
  + Diversity of relationships among the elements of the system. The components of the system can have simple relationships (e.g., being bonded by an ionic bond) or complex ones (e.g., mating or being food for another). Diversity refers to how many types of different relationships exist among the elements of a system.
  + Diversity of information transferred in the relationships. In the relationships among elements of the system, information is transferred. It can be energy or bits of information, depending on the type of system.
+ Let’s examine in more detail, considering the three characteristics mentioned above, the system examples we used earlier:
  + Liquid water:
    + The internal structure of liquid water is very simple. It only has elements of two types: oxygen and hydrogen.
    + The relationships among these elements are also simple and easily describable. Oxygen and hydrogen are bonded by covalent bonds, and the water molecules are bonded to each other via hydrogen bonds. Thus, there are only two types of relationships in this system.
    + The only information present in the system relates to these bonds. The molecules transfer a small amount of energy to each other, which is also easily quantifiable.
  + Storm:
    + The structure of this system is somewhat more complex. In addition to liquid water, there is also water in a gaseous state and suspended aerosols. Moreover, there are electromagnetic charges. In this system, a hierarchy in its structure begins to take shape. Water molecules bond with each other, and at the same time, aerosols have their own molecular configuration.
    + The relationships are also more complex. So much so that it would be difficult to enumerate them all here.
    + The elements of this system "process" more energy than the previous example.
  + Ecosystem:
    + Here, we make a huge leap in structural complexity. At first glance, we see that the ecosystem we used as an example (coral reef) has hundreds of different elements (species of living beings). Moreover, each of the organisms that constitute it is made up of trillions of cells that can be of different types. Finally, in each cell, there are also thousands of different types of molecules. Although the elemental compounds may be similar (atoms of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, etc.), the coral reef exhibits far greater structural complexity. There is a clear hierarchy in the structure. Additionally, it is as if this system were made up of many simpler systems.
    + There is also tremendous complexity in the relationships. The molecules in the cells interact through complex reactions, the cells interact with each other, just as the organisms do. There is also a hierarchy in the relationships. The food web of the system is the upper hierarchy in this case.
    + A vast amount of information flows through the relationships in an ecosystem. So much so that in some cases, systems of information transfer similar to human language are observed. A bee communicates with its hive mates, and plants communicate with each other through volatile hormones, etc.
+ It seems that there is a clear pattern in the examples we have seen. The complexity of the system increases as the three characteristics we have used to describe them increase. This increase in complexity can be described through the process of "emergence." As systems become more complex, characteristics that were not present in the elements constituting that system begin to "emerge." We call these characteristics "emergent properties." [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16W7c0mb-rE) video illustrates the concept of emergent property very well. This emergence makes a complex system much more than the sum of its parts. That "much more" is made up of emergent properties. Furthermore, as we have more complex systems, the emergent properties are also more complex. Let’s examine in some detail some of the most important emergent properties:
  + Self-organization. This property refers to the ability of some systems to maintain and reproduce their internal structure autonomously, even when environmental conditions change (within certain limits). Liquid water has a limited capacity for self-organization. A storm has somewhat more capacity for self-organization. An ecosystem has a tremendous capacity to maintain and reproduce its structure. This capacity is achieved through several mechanisms. The most common are feedback loops. Negative feedback loops tend to reduce variation in the system. When the values of a variable inherent to the system increase, mechanisms are triggered that tend to lower those values. An example of these mechanisms in an ecosystem might be the number of predators. When the number of predators exceeds a certain threshold, mechanisms are activated to reduce their number. This feedback mechanism arises due to the multiple (often random) relationships among the elements of the system. There are also positive feedback loops. In them, the tendency is to maximize variation in the system. In a storm, for example, we observe that the greater the temperature gradient, the more intense the storm becomes. Beyond these feedback loops, some systems have more complex self-organization mechanisms. In an ecosystem, for example, part of its structure is stored in the genes of the organisms that comprise it. Human culture is another example of a "learned" self-organization mechanism.
  + Non-linearity. This emergent property is very important for ecosystem management. By this term, we mean that a system responds non-linearly to internal or external changes. In a glass of water, for example, we observe that the evaporation rate is directly proportional to temperature. In a storm, however, this is not the case. Minor changes in topography, for example, might trigger significant changes in the amount of rainfall. Non-linear processes also occur in ecosystems. Removing a species from an ecosystem has non-linear effects that depend on the type of relationships that species has with the rest of the ecosystem.
  + Unpredictability. This other emergent property is crucial in our case. The fact that relationships are non-linear in complex systems makes their behavior very difficult or impossible to predict. It is easy to predict how much water will evaporate at a given temperature, but it is very difficult to know, for example, how much primary production an ecosystem will generate under certain environmental conditions. For us (students of ecosystem management), this emergent property is fundamental because it makes our discipline incredibly complex. We will almost never know in advance the outcomes of management measures. This also explains why in ecology (and in ecosystem management), the response "it depends" is so common to almost any question.
  + Adaptability. This property refers to the ability of systems to remain unaffected by external disturbances. The intensity of the relationships among their elements makes them somewhat "independent" of the environment. A glass of water is much less adaptive than an ecosystem. Even if there is a lot of water in the ecosystem... The storm is also, to some extent, adaptive because it "tries" to maintain its structure regardless of its environment. Adaptability is a concept similar to resistance.
  + Resilience: The last emergent property we will see is almost exclusive to systems involving living beings. A storm cannot regenerate itself if it is destroyed by an external disturbance. However, an ecosystem has considerable capacity to return to its initial state after being affected by a disturbance. Ecological succession is, as we saw in ecology, a good example of a resilience mechanism in an ecosystem.
+ All the properties we have seen depend directly on how complex a system is. We see that this pattern is present in all the systems we know. There seems to be a trend towards the emergence of increasingly complex systems. Why does this happen? Without delving into religious beliefs, it seems that the Universe favors complex systems. Why? The reason lies in the concept of entropy. Complex systems are much more efficient than simple ones at dissipating energy and increasing the entropy of the Universe. And we have known for some time that the increase in entropy is a universal trend. Stated in somewhat simple terms, we could say that the same amount of matter in a simple system generates less entropy than the same amount of matter in a complex system. Therefore, whenever conditions allow (neither extremely hot nor extremely cold), the Universe promotes the creation of increasingly complex systems. In [this](https://youtu.be/DxL2HoqLbyA?si=ML6oYonj_OxprA5F) video, you can find a detailed description of the concept of entropy.
+ Although the complexity of systems follows a gradient, some authors define three discrete types of systems:
  + Simple systems. They have almost no emergent properties. They are non-self-organized and not adaptive.
  + Complex systems. They begin to be unpredictable and have certain adaptive traits. In their structure and functioning, they integrate and transcend simple systems. That is, they contain elements of simple systems and at the same time manifest beyond their limits.
  + Adaptive complex systems. These are the most complex systems we know. These are the systems we will study throughout the course. Like in the previous case, adaptive complex systems integrate and transcend non-adaptive ones.

This theoretical session aims to raise awareness of the complexity we face. Thus, ecosystem management is a complex discipline, like the systems it addresses...
